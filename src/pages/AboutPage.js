          <p>
            Until now, Moringa alumni have lacked a specific space to connect
            with one another. With the Moringa Alumni Platform, we aim to bridge
            that gap, creating a space where alumni can interact and share:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Success stories</li>
            <li>Technical discussions</li>
            <li>Fundraising opportunities</li>
            <li>Collaborations with other developers and co-founders</li>
